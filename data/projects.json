        "description": "This project involved developing a PLC program to control a conveyor system that moves to a specific position based on distance input in centimeters using sensor feedback. The HMI was designed to allow users to input parameters, monitor system status, and control conveyor operation in real time. The system was tested and debugged to ensure accurate positioning, stable PLC–HMI communication, and reliable operation for training purposes.",
